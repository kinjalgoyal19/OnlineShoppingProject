# OnlineShoppingProject

In today's rapidly evolving shopping landscape, staying ahead is crucial for sellers, necessitating a seamless shift from offline to online selling. This paradigm shift has led to exponential growth in the online selling model. As an engineer, the primary objective is to facilitate this transition for sellers by streamlining their processes. A pivotal aspect of any successful online site is an efficient and robust database system. Therefore, the project focuses on designing a comprehensive database system to manage and organize orders from numerous customers within a Shopping Complex. This database will serve as the backbone of the online platform, ensuring smooth operations and enhancing the overall shopping experience for both sellers and customers alike.
